## üåü Introduction

This is an advanced intelligent real-time conversation system built on OpenAI's Realtime API, featuring sophisticated debate analysis and seamless human-AI collaborative discussion capabilities. The system intelligently identifies conversation positions, extracts key viewpoints, generates contextual key tags, and provides comprehensive real-time debate analysis with dynamic win rate calculations and topic identification.

### üöÄ Advancing Human-AI Collaboration

This system represents a breakthrough in human-AI collaborative intelligence, enabling natural, dynamic real-time discussions between humans and AI agents. It enhances critical thinking, develops advanced debate skills, and provides an innovative educational platform for interactive learning. The AI functions not merely as a tool, but as an intelligent collaborative partner capable of engaging in meaningful discussions, challenging perspectives constructively, and facilitating deep learning through sophisticated dialogue.

## üìã About the OpenAI Agents SDK

This project uses the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-js), a toolkit for building, managing, and deploying advanced AI agents. The SDK provides:

- A unified interface for defining agent behaviors and tool integrations
- Built-in support for agent orchestration, state management, and event handling
- Easy integration with the OpenAI Realtime API for low-latency, streaming interactions
- Extensible patterns for multi-agent collaboration, handoffs, tool use, and guardrails

For full documentation, guides, and API references, see the official [OpenAI Agents SDK Documentation](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-js#readme).

**NOTE:** For a version that does not use the OpenAI Agents SDK, see the [branch without-agents-sdk](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-agents/tree/without-agents-sdk).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Patterns

There are two main patterns demonstrated:

1. **Chat-Supervisor**: A realtime-based chat agent interacts with the user and handles basic tasks, while a more intelligent, text-based supervisor model (e.g., `gpt-4.1`) is used extensively for tool calls and more complex responses. This approach provides an easy onramp and high-quality answers, with a small increase in latency.

2. **Sequential Handoff**: Specialized agents (powered by realtime api) transfer the user between them to handle specific user intents. This is great for customer service, where user intents can be handled sequentially by specialist models that excel in a specific domains. This helps avoid the model having all instructions and tools in a single agent, which can degrade performance.

### Setup

- This is a Next.js typescript app. Install dependencies with `npm i`
- Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your env. Either add it to your `.bash_profile` or equivalent, or copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and add it there
- Start the server with `npm run dev`
- Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). It should default to the `chatSupervisor` Agent Config
- You can change examples via the "Scenario" dropdown in the top right

### Detailed Implementation

The system provides complete example implementations, including:

- Complex agent graph with user authentication, returns, sales, and human agent for escalations
- Escalation mechanisms for high-stakes decisions
- State machine-guided precise information collection
- Character-level confirmation systems

## üí° Next Steps

- You can copy these templates to make your own multi-agent voice app! Once you make a new agent set config, add it to `src/app/agentConfigs/index.ts` and you should be able to select it in the UI in the "Scenario" dropdown menu
- Each agentConfig can define instructions, tools, and toolLogic. By default all tool calls simply return `True`, unless you define the toolLogic, which will run your specific tool logic and return an object to the conversation (e.g. for retrieved RAG context)

## üõ°Ô∏è Output Guardrails

Assistant messages are checked for safety and compliance before they are shown in the UI. The guardrail call now lives directly inside `src/app/App.tsx`: when a `response.text.delta` stream starts we mark the message as **IN_PROGRESS**, and once the server emits `guardrail_tripped` or `response.done` we mark the message as **FAIL** or **PASS** respectively.

## ü§ù Pull Requests

Feel free to open an issue or pull request and we'll do our best to review it. The spirit of this repo is to demonstrate the core logic for new agentic flows; PRs that go beyond this core scope will likely not be merged.

## üôè Acknowledgments
